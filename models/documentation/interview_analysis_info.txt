MODEL: interview_analysis
==================================================

DESCRIPTION:
RoBERTa-based model for analyzing interview responses to measure confidence, clarity, relevance, and technical accuracy.

IDEAL INPUT FORMAT:

I've been working with Python for over 5 years, specializing in machine learning applications.
At my previous job, I implemented a recommendation system that increased user engagement by 25%.
I'm particularly skilled in TensorFlow and PyTorch for building deep learning models.
I also have experience leading a team of 3 junior developers, mentoring them on best practices.

For scaling challenges, I've used AWS Lambda with DynamoDB to handle millions of requests per day.
My approach to problem-solving involves breaking down complex issues into manageable components,
and I believe in thorough testing at every stage of development.
